# Environments
・This sample project uses [this repository](https://github.com/TakashiYoshinaga/Azure-Kinect-Sample-for-Unity) to generate point cloud data in Unity.  
・AR marker detection and pose estimation is done using [OpenCV plus Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/opencv-plus-unity-85928?locale=ja-JP) assets.  

# Notes
・For maintainability reasons, it is more appropriate to purchase paid [assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/azure-kinect-examples-for-unity-149700?locale=ja-JP) or refer to the [Microsoft installation](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Samples/tree/master/body-tracking-samples/sample_unity_bodytracking) instructions as a way to use Azure Kinect with Unity.  
．I couldn't get it to install properly, but [NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity) is a way to use the latest version of [OpenCV](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp).
